            <h3>Chocolate-Covered Strawberries</h3>
            <p>
                This is the simplest version of chocolate covered strawberries I know. 
                Paraffin was originally used instead of shortening. 
                Turn the strawberries upside down and insert by the toothpicks into a piece of styrofoam for easy cooling, or simply place them on a sheet of wax paper. 
                White chocolate may be drizzled over the milk chocolate for a fancier look. 
                They are perfect for weddings when decorated with frosting bow ties, bells, butterflies, roses, etc.
